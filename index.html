					<h3>Roots of counterpoint</h3>

					<small>
						Counterpoint originates in the 9th century,
						starting with the Gregorian Chant, a religious song that
						would be similar to the Cantus Firmi that I'll get into later.

					<small>The real blossuming of counterpoint was when Johan
						Fux published his book "Gradus ad Parnassum" which
						revolutionized counterpoint through polyphony. It is so integral to music as a
						whole that even if you have
						never listened to classical music, you likely hear it every
						day. TAKE THAT Pop music! If you listen to voices (which don't have to be vocal)
						that combine and have conflict, you've listened to counterpoint.

					<h2>The Point</h2>
					<small>
						For the
						"point" of the counterpoint I did and the
						counterpoint you'll hear about here, I
						used something called a Cantus Firmus,
						which is a simple melody that uses no
						dynamics (changes in volume), rhythm,
						and follows a strict set of rules (you can learn more below).
						<br>If you were to visualize one of the ones I wrote, it would
						look something like this (this is an actual Cantus Firmus,
						the dots represent notes):

					</small>
					<img src="chart (1).png" class="r-stretch">
					<small>Looking at this, you can see how it approaches the end by steps down and you also can see how
						it has only one peak, so that we know that this Cantus Firmus is only one "mountain", which is
						important as it maintains the balance of how (if we're running with this mountain metaphor) the
						mountain positioned within the frame, like a good picture. We can also see how the slopes don't
						just make large erratic jumps which might make the "mountain" harder to climb</small>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>How Cantus Firmi work</h2>
					<small>A Cantus Firmus is
						a simple line of whole
						notes that is useful for
						learning counterpoint. The
						reason that someone learns
						how to do Cantus Firmi is so
						that you learn about what all
						music is based on, dating back
						to the Gregorian chants I talked
						about in the "Roots of Counterpoint" section.

					<h2>Cantus Firmi 101</h2>
					<p>clearly the most useful skill ever, that you will definately use every day, especially if you
						don't write music</p>
					<small>
						How to write Cantus Firmi, a step by step guide:<br>
						<ol>
							<li>Chose a key (A minor, D major etc.)</li>
							<li>Write the tonic of that key (F for F major, G for G minor, etc.) as the first note</li>
							<li>Write notes after that that follow the rules of Cantus Firmi:
								<ul>
									<li>5ths and octaves are called perfect intervals</li>
									<li>No jumping by 4ths, 4ths are nasty</li>
									<li>Use perfect intervals sparingly</li>
									<li>have at least one step (not leap) in between leaps</li>
									<li>Use leaps, like perfect intervals, sparingly</li>
									<li>Approach the end with steps and leave the first note by steps</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ol>

					<h2>The Counterpoint</h2>
					<small>A counterpoint is something
						to make the piece of music interesting, to counter the point.
						In the counterpoint that I did, Second species two part counterpoint,
						there are only two voices, and only two against one rhythm (half notes
						against whole notes) We'll use the same Cantus Firmus, but now with a
						counterpoint on top. It looks like this:
					</small>
					<img class="r-stretch" src="chartco.png" \>
					<br><small>You can see the two against one and how the two voices sometimes look like reflections.
						The reflections are called contrary motion and they are something that you want to see a lot for
						the counterpoint.</small>
